## About

I optimize systems under constraints. Whether managing supply chains or training neural networks, the goal is the same: **maximum performance, minimum waste**.

**Background:** 10+ years in operations and supply chain → systematic pivot to AI/ML (2024-2025)

**Current Focus:** Understanding sequence model architectures from first principles—implementing RNNs, Transformers, and State Space Models (Mamba) to see *why* they work, not just *that* they work.

**Next:** Applying to AI Master's programs in Europe (Fall 2026) focused on embodied AI and efficient architectures.
