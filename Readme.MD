## 🚀 About Me

**From Operations to AI/ML Engineering** – I bring a unique perspective to machine learning: I understand **efficiency** (from 6 years in supply chain operations), **business impact** (from analytics work), and **production deployment** (from recent deep ML engineering).

**🎯 What Makes Me Different:** Most ML engineers optimize for accuracy. I optimize for **deployability, efficiency, and real-world constraints** because I've managed physical operations where compute, energy, and time actually matter.

**📈 Career Evolution:** 
- **2017-2023**: Supply Chain Operations → Business Analytics → Data Science (Toronto)
- **2024**: Deep dive into production ML systems (M2M Tech multimodal AI project)
- **2024-Now**: Building AI agents, researching model architectures

**🔬 Current Research Interests:** 
- **Embodied AI & World Models**: Moving beyond text-only transformers toward physically-grounded intelligence
- **Efficient Architectures**: State Space Models (Mamba), JEPA, alternatives to O(n²) attention
- **Neuro-Symbolic AI**: Combining neural networks with explicit graph structure (GNNs) for compositional reasoning
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Intelligent orchestration and emergent behavior

**🛠️ Recent Projects:** 
- Multi-agent research assistant (Google Gemini orchestration, 40-60% faster paper comprehension)
- Model merging investigation (FrankenBERT - exposed catastrophic interference in naive merging)
- Multilingual video pipeline (Whisper + mBART + synthesis, 50+ languages, 95% accuracy)

**✍️ Technical Writing:** Publishing deep-dives on AI fundamentals, architecture evolution, and the path to AGI at [**The Meta Gradient**](https://substack.com/@vinodanbalagan)

**🎓 Formal Training:** 
- University of Toronto (ML & Data Science Certification, 2024)
- Stanford University (ML Specialization, 2024)
- University of Windsor (M.A.Sc. Electrical Engineering, 2017)
- Anna University (B.E. Electronics & Communication, 2012)

**🌍 What I'm Looking For:** 
- **Master's programs** in AI/ML (Europe, Fall 2026) focusing on embodied AI, efficient architectures, multimodal learning
- Research collaborations on state space models, neuro-symbolic AI, world models
- Open-source contributors for experimental projects exploring alternatives to transformer scaling

## 🔬 Currently Working On

- 🧠 **State Space Models (Mamba)**: Investigating linear-time alternatives to quadratic transformers for sequential modeling
- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Building intelligent routing between specialized AI agents (Google Gemini)
- 🎯 **Neuro-Symbolic Architectures**: Exploring GNN + SSM hybrids for physical reasoning tasks
- 📚 **Research Tools**: AI agents for accelerating paper comprehension and knowledge retention
- ✍️ **Technical Writing**: Documenting the journey from RNNs → Transformers → State Space Models

## 🏆 Featured Projects

### 📚 SSM Learning Journey | In Progress
**Deep Dive into Sequence Models | Dec 2024 - Feb 2025**

**The Goal:** Understand sequence modeling evolution by implementing 
each architecture from scratch.

**Current Progress:**
- ✅ Week 1-2: RNN/LSTM vanishing gradient visualization
- 🔄 Week 3-4: Transformer complexity analysis (in progress)
- 📅 Week 5-8: Mamba implementation (planned)

**Why This Matters:** Moving beyond just using libraries to 
understanding *why* architectures evolved. Documenting insights 
on [The Meta Gradient](substack.com/@vinodanbalagan).

**Tech Stack:** PyTorch (from scratch), comparative benchmarking, 
physics-based tasks

---

### 🤖 Research Paper Chat | Multi-Agent AI System
**Google 5-Day AI Intensive Capstone | Nov 2024**

[🚀 Live Demo](https://vinodanbalagan-research-paper-chat-app-x3nxo4.streamlit.app/) | [📝 Technical Writeup](https://substack.com/@vinodanbalagan/note/p-180365459?utm_source=notes-share-action&r=g5tza)

**The Problem:** Reading ML papers takes 2-4 hours. Math notation is dense. Code snippets require translation. Concepts need context.

**The Solution:** Domain-specialized AI agents (Math, Code, Concept, Quiz, Chat) with intelligent orchestration.

**Why It's Interesting:**
- **Agent Routing**: Analyzes query intent, routes to appropriate specialist (not just keyword matching)
- **Context Management**: Maintains conversation state across agent switches
- **Production-Ready**: Error handling, cost optimization (~$0.001/query), deployed on Streamlit Cloud
- **Measurable Impact**: 40-60% faster paper comprehension in user testing

**Tech Stack:** Google Gemini 2.0 Flash, Streamlit, PDF parsing (regex-based section extraction), state management

**Key Insight:** Intelligence emerges from **coordination**, not just scale. Five small specialists outperform one large generalist for structured tasks.

🎬 Global Sound Evolution | Multilingual Video Pipeline
Production ML System | 2024
🚀 Live Demo | 💻 GitHub
What It Does: Transcribe → Translate → Re-synthesize video in 50+ languages
Technical Pipeline:

Speech-to-Text: OpenAI Whisper (noise-resilient, 95% accuracy)
Translation: mBART-50 (multilingual seq2seq)
Text-to-Speech: ElevenLabs API (natural voice cloning)
Video Synthesis: MoviePy (subtitle overlay + audio sync)

Production Lessons:

Long-form audio requires chunking strategy (avoid memory overflow)
Subtitle timing needs offset calibration (speech synthesis != original timing)
User feedback: "I can finally share my research talks with my non-English-speaking family"

**Note:** This was a pipeline integration project to understand 
multimodal AI workflows. The individual models (Whisper, mBART) 
are pre-trained; my contribution was the orchestration, error 
handling, and production deployment.


## 📈 Real-World Impact

### 🎯 From My Analytics & Operations Work (2017-2023)

| Category | Project | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| 💰 Revenue Growth | Predictive Analytics (Organics Retailer) | **+25%** revenue |
| 💵 Cost Savings | Inventory Optimization (Whole Foods) | **$500K** prevented stockouts |
| ⚙️ Efficiency | Waste Reduction (Supply Chain) | **-20%** waste |
| ⏱️ Automation | Reporting Systems | **15 hrs/week** saved |

**Key Takeaway:** I learned to build systems that **actually get used** in production, with measurable ROI. This operations mindset carries into my ML work.

## 🔬 Research Philosophy

> **"Intelligence ≠ Language. True AI requires physical grounding, energy constraints, and embodied learning."**

### What I Believe:

**1. Beyond Text-Only LLMs**
- Current LLMs mimic the **output** of intelligence (language statistics)
- True intelligence requires understanding **causality** and **physics**
- A dog knows more about the world than GPT-4 (despite smaller "parameters")

**2. Efficiency as First Principle**
- Biological intelligence evolved to **optimize energy** in scarce environments
- AI without resource constraints has no incentive for efficiency, only verbosity
- My operations background: I've lived scarcity. I build systems that respect compute budgets.

**3. Architectural Innovation > Scaling**
- Transformers: O(n²) attention is the bottleneck
- State Space Models (Mamba): O(n) recurrence with selective memory
- JEPA: Predict abstract states, not pixels (avoid "heavy library" of generative models)
- Neuro-symbolic: Graph structure + neural learning = compositional reasoning

**4. Embodied AI**
- Learning requires "jeopardy" (consequences, energy loss, failure)
- Multimodal fusion: Vision + touch + proprioception, not just text
- World models: Simulate physics internally before acting

### Applying to Master's Programs:

I'm seeking **research-oriented Master's programs** where I can explore:
- State space models for efficient sequential processing
- Neuro-symbolic architectures (GNNs + SSMs) for physical reasoning
- Embodied agents that learn from interaction, not just text
- Multimodal world models grounded in physics

**Target regions:** Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Germany (Fall 2026)
