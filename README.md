# üöÄ Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio  

## Machine Learning Engineer  

I bridge cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning research with real-world implementations to solve complex business challenges. With 3+ years of analytics experience across procurement, media production, and data management roles, I bring technical depth and business acumen to ML projects. Currently studying Machine Learning at the University of Toronto and completed Stanford's ML specialization. At M2M Tech, I'm developing a real-time audio translation system that accurately detects code-switching with low-latency. Proficient in Python, SQL, Tableau, major ML frameworks, and cloud platforms, I excel at cross-functional collaboration and translating technical concepts for non-technical stakeholders. My strong problem-solving abilities and data storytelling skills complement my technical expertise in creating accessible, human-centered AI systems. Open to relocation and eager to contribute to dynamic, research-driven teams.
