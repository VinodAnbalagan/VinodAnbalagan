# üöÄ Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio  

I am a **Machine Learning & AI Researcher in the making**, passionate about building **intelligent systems** that drive innovation and solve real-world problems. My journey into **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science** has been shaped by rigorous self-learning, university coursework, and **hands-on project experience at M2M Tech**, where I am currently working on **AI-driven data science projects**.  

Through **Stanford‚Äôs Machine Learning Specialization**, the **University of Toronto‚Äôs Data Science & ML Certification**, and practical experience, I have developed expertise in **data analysis, predictive modeling, neural networks, and data engineering workflows**. I am particularly drawn to **computer vision, generative AI, and reinforcement learning**, areas where AI is transforming industries.  

Beyond technical skills, I thrive in **collaborative environments** where I can contribute, learn, and refine innovative solutions. My goal is to **push the boundaries of AI research and development**, continuously exploring new frameworks, methodologies, and applications.
